# Procedural Memory

Active patterns and procedures for this project. Patterns here are accessed regularly and guide day-to-day work.

## Pattern Guidelines

### Pattern Size
- **Target**: 50-100 lines per pattern
- **Maximum**: 100 lines (move excess to `/docs/guides/patterns/`)
- **Minimum**: 30 lines (too short = incomplete)

### Required Sections
Every pattern must include:
1. When to Use
2. Success Metrics
3. Core Approach
4. Common Pitfalls
5. See Also
6. Metadata

### Adding New Patterns
1. Check if pattern already exists (search first)
2. Use the template below
3. Add appropriate metadata
4. Link to documentation if complex

---

## Pattern Template

```markdown
## Pattern: [Name] ([Date])

### When to Use
- Trigger condition 1
- Trigger condition 2
- Use case scenario

### Success Metrics
- Measurable outcome 1
- Measurable outcome 2
- Verification method

### Core Approach

**Problem**: Brief description

**Solution**:
1. Step 1 with key command/code
2. Step 2 with key command/code
3. Step 3 with key command/code

**Key Code Example** (max 1-2 examples):
```language
// Essential code only - 10-20 lines max
key_function() {
    critical_logic_here()
}
```

**Critical Rules**:
- DON'T: Anti-pattern
- DO: Best practice

### Common Pitfalls
- Pitfall 1: What goes wrong
- Pitfall 2: How to avoid
